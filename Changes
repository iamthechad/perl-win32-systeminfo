	  as bytes.

0.06 - Added new entry to processor information hash to display the name
          of the processor. WindowsNT and 2K now use the DLL to determine
          CPU speed as well.

0.07 - Changed contact information. Recompiled DLL to remove some extraneous calls.   

0.08 - Added more definitions for recent CPUs. Added dependency on version 0.40
          of Win32::API. Reworked Win32::API calls. Changed calls in DLL to
          eliminate need to pack and unpack arguments.

0.09 - Eliminated cpuspd.dll. Should eliminate some of the headaches associated with
          using this module. It should now return CPU info for all flavors of 
          Windows past Win9x without crashing.
